# Enrichment_analysis

Continuation of the repository RNAseq_skn: RNAseq analysis pipeline of PRJEB38244 bioproject made for meeting of Bioinformatics Science Club. 
The RNAseq analysis you can find here: https://github.com/wwilman/RNAseq_skn

This repository contains the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, KEGG Gene Set Enrichment Analysis and Over-Representation Analysis  of the results for the comparison analysis of Arabidopsis Col-0 wild-type and fbl17 mutant transcriptomes to study the implication of FBL17 in cell cycle regulation and DNA damage responses. 

This part of analysis where conducted by guide on https://learn.gencore.bio.nyu.edu/rna-seq-analysis/
